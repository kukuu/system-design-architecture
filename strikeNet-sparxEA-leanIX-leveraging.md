# Leveraging SPARX EA and LeanIX for StrikeNet (UK MoD Digital Twin) and Repair Smart (BAE, AirBus, SPIRIT)

## StrikeNet
- SPARX EA was in use to architect the combat system virtualization using SysML to simulate AI-driven scenarios e.g., threat prediction, with LeanIX auditing AWS/AZURE costs and Cyber Essentials compliance. 

 - MoD Stakeholders strategists reviewed SPARX EA’s simulation traces against LeanIX risk registers, ensuring AI recommendations align with "cost-efficient resilience."

## Repair Smart

- For Repair Smart, SPARX EA’s Activity Diagrams was used to validate AI search algorithms against repair SLAs, while LeanIX was used for benchmarking time savings against industry standards (e.g., MRO).
