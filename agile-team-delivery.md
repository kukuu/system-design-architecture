## Agile Team Delivery

**Case study:**


_You have been assigned to manage one squad struggling with performance; they’ve not had an Engineering Manager for a few months. You are responsible for creating a high-performing team that can deliver on its goals. At Skyscanner, a squad is an agile product team with 6-8 engineers, led by an engineering manager; a tribe is a group of squads with similar product domains, usually led by an Engineering Director and a Product Director_ 

_There are 7 people in this squad:
2 x graduates called Ben and Flo; Ben joined recently,
2 x engineers, Lucy and Becka; Becka rotated in from another squad in the last month,
2 x senior engineers, Valerie and Drew; Valerie has been in the squad for four years, Drew joined the company last year, and
a principal engineer, Magnus (who has been acting as squad lead and Product Owner).
These are the notes your line manager, Paul, has given you. Paul has been managing the team’s individual development plans and is planning to hand these over to you in due course.
The squad own a number of back-end services that are critical to Skyscanner; they have no front-end components (Headless CMS).
The squad spend a lot of time on support issues. Each investigation can take a long time.
The squad delivers very few new features/changes due to the load from the support requests
Pressure is starting to mount from the tribe leadership team.
The squad has been working on their current strategic project for almost a year which is longer than expected.''. Higlight in a couple of paragraphs and not too long by acknowledging the challenges in the team and  how you can make the team efficient, work towards a common goal and also what initial actions and plans you prioritise to streamline the team to align with the business challenges and meet stakeholders expectations._


**Solution**:

**- Acknowledging Challenges:**

The squad faces three core issues: (1) unbalanced workloads from support demands stifling feature delivery, (2) lack of clear ownership due to interim leadership and role transitions, and (3) prolonged project timelines eroding stakeholder confidence. With critical back-end services and mounting tribal pressure, the priority is ‘’stabilizing operations while realigning the team toward strategic goals’’.

**- Initial Actions & Plan:**

i. Triage & Prioritization (Weeks 1-2):

ii. Audit support issues with Magnus to identify patterns (e.g., recurring bugs, poorly documented systems). Implement a rotational support schedule (e.g., Seniors handle Tier 3 issues; Graduates shadow/Tier 1 triage) to free up bandwidth.

iii. Work with Paul to clarify the strategic project’s MVP scope and negotiate deadlines with tribal leadership.

**Team Alignment (Weeks 3-4):**

1. Host a working session to redefine squad goals using the Objectives and Key Results (OKR) framework, ensuring everyone (especially new members like Becka/Drew) understands how their work ladders up to business outcomes.

ii. Pair Valerie’s tribal knowledge with Drew’s fresh perspective to document tribal knowledge and streamline onboarding.

**Process Efficiency (Ongoing):**

i. Introduce blameless postmortems for support issues to identify root causes (e.g., tech debt, monitoring gaps). Partner with Magnus to advocate for tribal resources to address systemic problems.

ii. Shift-left testing by embedding automated alerts/runbooks (e.g., via PagerDuty/Sentry) to reduce manual investigation time.

**Expected Outcomes:**

i. Within 6 weeks: 30% reduction in support load via triage automation and role clarity.

ii. Within 3 months: Clear OKR progress with incremental feature delivery, rebuilding stakeholder trust.

**Why This Works:**

i. Balances short-term fixes (support rotation) with long-term strategy (OKRs, documentation).

ii. Leverages existing strengths (Valerie’s tenure, Magnus’s technical leadership) while integrating new members.

iii. Aligns with Skyscanner’s agile culture through collaborative goal-setting and measurable outcomes.
