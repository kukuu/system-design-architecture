# Cloud  Migration Modelling with  SPARX EA

SPARX EA is used to design, document, and visualize the migration process. Below are the steps:

**1. Define AS-IS and TO-BE Architecture**

_AS-IS Model:_

i. Use ArchiMate or UML to map existing on-premises infrastructure (e.g., servers, databases, applications).

ii. Tag components with metadata (e.g., Owner, Dependencies, Legacy Constraints).

_TO-BE Model:_

i. Design the target cloud architecture (e.g., AWS VPC, EC2, RDS, S3).

ii. Use Deployment Diagrams to map cloud services and connectivity.

**2. Technical Implementation Steps**

_Phase 1: Assessment_

i. Create a BPMN diagram to evaluate dependencies and risks (e.g., data residency, latency).

ii. Use Requirement Diagrams to define non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, security).

_Phase 2: Migration Planning_

i. Model migration waves using Activity Diagrams (e.g., lift-and-shift, re-platforming).

ii. Assign stereotypes to components (e.g., <<Legacy>>, <<CloudReady>>).

_Phase 3: Execution_

i. Use Sequence Diagrams to validate data migration workflows (e.g., ETL processes).

_Phase 4: Optimization_

i. Model auto-scaling rules, monitoring, and cost governance in Component Diagrams.

**3. Deployment in SPARX EA**

- Traceability Matrix: Link requirements, risks, and migration tasks using Relationship Matrices.

- Version Control: Use Baselines to track changes between AS-IS and TO-BE models.

- Reporting: Generate HTML/PDF reports for stakeholders using EAâ€™s template builder.

# Cost/Risk Tracking in LeanIX
Integrate SPARX EA outputs into LeanIX for continuous governance:

- 1. Export SPARX EA Data

Export models as CSV/Excel or use LeanIX REST API to sync Application/IT Component inventories.

- 2. Enrich Fact Sheets in LeanIX

i. Add cost attributes (e.g., Monthly Cloud Spend, Licensing Fees) to Fact Sheets.

ii. Tag risks (e.g., <<DataComplianceRisk>>, <<VendorLockIn>>) using Custom Tags.

- 3. Create Dashboards

i. Build Cost Explorer dashboards to compare on-prem vs. cloud costs.

ii. Use Risk Heatmaps to prioritize mitigation (e.g., encryption for data residency risks).


- 4. Automate Governance

i. Set up LeanIX Surveys to validate cost/risk assumptions post-migration.

ii. Trigger Jira Tickets for high-risk items via integrations.
