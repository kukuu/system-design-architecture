- Use: Simplify technical models into high-level roadmaps using ArchiMate or SWOT analysis.

### Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure

- Feature: Cloud Modeling (AWS/Azure stencils).

- Use: Design multi-cloud architectures and map integrations (e.g., VPCs, IAM roles).

### APIs & Loosely Coupled Architecture

- Feature: API Interface Modeling (OpenAPI/Swagger).

- Use: Diagram REST/SOAP endpoints and decoupled event-driven workflows.

### Tools (IBM API Connect, AWS API Gateway)

- Feature: Integration with API Gateways.

- Use: Model gateway policies, rate limits, and security (OAuth/JWT).

### Dev Styles (XP, TDD, Scrum)

- Feature: Agile Modeling & Traceability.

- Use: Link user stories to components and track iterations via Kanban boards.

### Services Orchestration & Middleware

- Feature: Message Flow Diagrams (AMQP, SQS).

- Use: Model event choreography (e.g., Kafka topics) and middleware logic (IBM DataPower).

### DevOps Toolchains

- Feature: CI/CD Pipeline Modeling.

- Use: Visualize Jenkins pipelines or Terraform deployments with version control.

### Network Protocols

- Feature: Network Topology Diagrams.

- Use: Map TCP/IP layers, HTTP/2 flows, and WebSocket handshakes.

### BI & Data Warehousing

Feature: Data Modeling (ER Diagrams).

Use: Design schemas for Informatica ETL workflows or SAP Business Objects cubes.

## LeanIX  - Inventory & Governance Focus

### Stakeholder Management

- Feature: Stakeholder Surveys & Heatmaps.

- Use: Identify key influencers and track concerns via collaborative workshops.

### Governance

- Feature: Lifecycle Management & Compliance.

- Use: Enforce cloud spend policies (e.g., "No unapproved SaaS tools") and audit controls.

### Client-Facing Skills

- Feature: Value Stream Mapping.

- Use: Show ROI of IT initiatives (e.g., cost savings from API consolidation).

### C-Suite Presentations

- Feature: KPI Dashboards & Tech Radars.

- Use: Highlight modernization progress (e.g., "% Legacy Systems Retired").

### Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure

- Feature: Cloud Spend Analytics.

- Use: Track AWS/Azure usage costs and optimize resource allocation.

### APIs & Loosely Coupled Architecture

- Feature: API Inventory & Dependency Mapping.

- Use: Monitor API usage metrics and assess risks of deprecated endpoints.

### Tools (IBM API Connect, AWS API Gateway)

- Feature: Integration Catalog.

- Use: Track gateway uptime/SLAs and vendor contracts.

### Dev Styles (XP, TDD, Scrum)

- Feature: Initiative Roadmaps.

- Use: Align Scrum sprints with strategic goals (e.g., "Migrate 50% to microservices by Q3").

### Services Orchestration & Middleware

- Feature: Integration Health Monitoring.

- Use: Assess middleware risks (e.g., IBM MQ EOL) and plan upgrades.

### DevOps Toolchains

- Feature: Toolchain Impact Analysis.

- Use: Evaluate DevOps tool redundancy (e.g., consolidate Jenkins/GitLab CI).

### Network Protocols

- Feature: Security Posture Assessment.

- Use: Flag non-HTTPS endpoints or outdated TLS versions.

### BI & Data Warehousing

- Feature: Data Asset Inventory.

- Use: Catalog Informatica workflows and SAP BO reports for GDPR compliance.

## Key Collaboration Strategy

- Sparx EA → LeanIX: Export models to LeanIX for governance tracking.

- LeanIX → Sparx EA: Import inventory data to refine architecture models.

- Example: Model a cloud migration in Sparx EA, then track its cost/risk in LeanIX.

**By focusing Sparx EA on design/execution and LeanIX on inventory/governance, you ensure alignment between technical depth and business oversight.**
